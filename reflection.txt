Based on this lab, why is using branches a powerful and safe way for a team of
software engineers to collaborate on a single project? What problems might it
prevent?

Branches are powerful because they allow a team of software engineers to work 
on different features or fixes independently from the main branch. By isolating 
changes in separate branches, teams can avoid accidentally overwriting each other’s work. 
This approach also helps prevent merge conflicts from becoming overwhelming and 
keeps the project history organized and manageable.
